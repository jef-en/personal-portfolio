              Philippine by centralising the veterinary shops in the area.
            </span>
            The application boasts
            <span class="highlight">four main features</span>:
            <span class="highlight">Pet Record</span> - which provides a
            platform for vets and pet owners to access the pet’s data, including
            vaccination records and medical history,
            <span class="highlight">Booking Vet Services</span> - which enables
            pet owners to view partner clinic schedules and schedule
            appointments at their preferred time and date,
            <span class="highlight">Marketplace</span> - which offers a diverse
            range of pet-related products for sale, catering to the needs of pet
            owners and enthusiasts, and <span class="highlight">Events</span> -
            which displays upcoming pet-related events (e.g., Free Neuter and
            Spay), ensuring users stay informed and can attend relevant events.

          <p class="pawhub_sub reveal">Identifying the Problem.</p>
          <p class="pawhub_desc reveal">
            Pet owners in Naga City faced significant challenges due to the lack
            of centralised veterinary services.
            <span class="highlight"
              >The absence of a unified platform made it difficult for them to
              find and choose nearby veterinary services that met their
              needs.</span
            >
            This lack of centralization led to inefficiencies and frustrations,
            as users had to search through various sources to locate and
            evaluate veterinary options.
          </p>
          <p class="pawhub_sub reveal">Research Findings.</p>
          <p class="pawhub_desc reveal">
            Through preliminary research and user interviews, we identified
            several key issues:
          </p>
          <ul class="pawhub_problem reveal">
            <li class="pawhub_desc">
              <span class="highlight">Fragmented Information:</span> Pet owners
              had to gather information from multiple sources, including
              scattered online listings and physical directories.
            </li>
            <li class="pawhub_desc">
              <span class="highlight">Accessibility Issues:</span> Without a
              centralised platform, users had trouble finding the most
              convenient and nearest veterinary services.
            </li>
            <li class="pawhub_desc">
              <span class="highlight">Lack of Comparative Data:</span> Users had
              limited means to compare services, reviews, and prices for
              veterinary care in their area.

          <p class="pawhub_desc reveal">
            The primary goal of Paw Hub is to create a mobile application that
            <span class="highlight"

              it easier for pet owners to access various veterinary services and
              compare prices.</span
            >
            One of its key features is the ability to show pet owners the
            nearest veterinary services based on their location. Additionally,
            the app includes a digital medical record system, allowing pet
            owners to store their pets' health information in a centralised,
            digital format.

            In this phase of the design process,
            <span class="highlight">
              I created mid-fidelity mockups to bring structure and
              functionality to the app's user interface. These mockups showcase
              the app's core layout, navigation, and interactions with more
              defined UI elements like buttons, text, and icons, while still
              allowing room for iteration.
            </span>
            They offer a clearer sense of the user experience, helping to
            visualize the flow and overall design before refining the final
            details in high-fidelity prototypes.
