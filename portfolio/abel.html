              Despite efforts to improve health literacy in the Philippines,
              there is still a need for innovative methods to expand outreach.
              This study explored using game-based learning to teach the
              prevention and control of communicable diseases through Dr. Abel's
              Adventure. Testing the game with Grade 8 students at Camarines Sur
              National High School showed that it improved health literacy.
              While the learning outcomes between the experimental and control
              groups didn’t differ significantly, the game successfully enhanced
              awareness. The study also emphasized the importance of clear
              instructions and game introductions for a better user experience.

              Starting a new project, especially with kids from different
              schools, was challenging, but I enjoyed collaborating with
              teachers and students. Despite facing obstacles, we focused on
              learning and improvement. I discovered my passion for the creative
              process, from story and character design to color choices, and
              worked hard to perfect every detail.
