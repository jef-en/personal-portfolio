          <p class="travel_desc">
            Traveling can be a stressful and uncertain experience, especially
            for solo travelers, backpackers, or those unfamiliar with their
            destination. Many travelers struggle to find clear, reliable, and
            detailed instructions on how to reach their destination, often
            relying on vague online guides or generic navigation tools. While
            platforms like Google Maps provide basic route information, they
            fail to account for essential details such as local fees, entrance
            charges, transportation options, and alternative routes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="travel_desc">
            For backpackers and solo travelers—who may not have access to
            private transportation or prefer to travel using local options—this
            lack of comprehensive guidance can lead to confusion, delays, and
            unnecessary stress. Furthermore, relying on general travel
            instructions or directions from various sources can result in
            fragmented information, making it difficult to plan a smooth,
            efficient journey.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="travel_desc">
            What’s missing is a solution that not only provides clear,
            step-by-step navigation but also integrates all the critical travel
            details—like costs, transportation modes, and real-time updates—into
            one cohesive, easy-to-follow platform.

        <div class="travel_goals">
          <p class="travel_title">03. Goals</p>
          <p class="travel_desc">
            The primary goal of this project is to create an intuitive and
            user-friendly UI design tailored for solo travelers and backpackers,
            providing them with detailed, reliable instructions on how to reach
            popular tourist destinations in the Philippines. The platform will
            guide users step-by-step, offering clear and practical directions,
            including transportation options, estimated travel times, entry
            fees, and other important details that are often overlooked by
            traditional navigation tools.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="travel_desc">
            The secondary goal is to build a product that aligns with the
            principles of Technopreneurship—combining innovation with business
            potential. By developing a unique travel solution, the project aims
            to fill a gap in the market for personalized, easy-to-follow travel
            assistance, while also creating opportunities for entrepreneurship
            in the tech space.

          <p class="travel_title">05. Learning and Takeaway.</p>
          <p class="travel_desc">
            One of the key takeaways from this project is the understanding that
            as a designer or developer, I am not creating for myself, but for
            others. My professor often emphasizes, "Once you enter the IT world,
            you're not designing or creating for yourself, but for your users."
            This is an essential mindset to adopt, especially when designing
            user interfaces. It's crucial to consider the needs, preferences,
            and challenges of the target audience to ensure the solution is
            truly effective and usable.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="travel_desc">
            For this project, I will be designing a tool for solo and backpack
            travelers—people with unique needs and experiences. Therefore, I
            must prioritize usability and accessibility in the design, ensuring
            that the interface is simple to navigate, visually appealing, and
            intuitive, even for those unfamiliar with technology.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="travel_desc">
            Additionally, another important learning is the necessity of
            designing for the CLI (Common Look and Feel) in the tech industry.
            This means ensuring that the design adheres to standard user
            interface principles, creating a consistent, familiar experience
            that users can quickly adapt to. It's not just about aesthetics but
            also about providing a seamless experience across devices and
            platforms, especially in the context of travel, where users might be
            using the app in unfamiliar environments with varying internet
            connections.
