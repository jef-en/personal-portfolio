            Go Jeep is a jeepney booking app developed in response to the
            challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Its primary objective is
            to provide a safer, more secure transportation experience for
            passengers and jeepney drivers by offering essential features such
            as contact tracing and advance booking. The app allows users to book
            a jeepney ride in advance, reducing the need for crowded jeepney
            terminals and minimizing physical interaction between passengers. In
            addition to offering a safer booking experience, Go Jeep integrates
            a contact tracing feature that helps track passenger movements for
            health and safety purposes. This ensures that in the event of an
            exposure, authorities can quickly trace individuals who may have
            been in close contact with an infected passenger, improving public
            health response efforts.

          <p class="jeep_desc">
            Operating jeepney transportation in a post-COVID world—often
            referred to as the "new normal"—presents significant challenges.
            Jeepneys, which are a primary mode of public transport in the
            Philippines, are inherently risky due to their nature as shared,
            crowded spaces. In a world still affected by the pandemic,
            passengers cannot easily determine if they are traveling with
            someone who may be infected. The lack of consistent and effective
            health screening at entry points, coupled with limited social
            distancing options inside jeepneys, increases the potential for
            virus transmission.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="jeep_desc">
            However, completely halting jeepney operations is not a feasible
            solution, as jeepney drivers rely on daily earnings to support their
            families. This creates a difficult balance between maintaining
            public health and supporting the livelihoods of drivers and other
            workers in the transportation sector. Thus, the challenge lies in
            finding a way to keep jeepney services running safely, without
            putting passengers and drivers at excessive risk, while also
            ensuring that drivers can continue earning a living. The solution
            will need to address both health and economic concerns in a
            sustainable way.

          <p class="jeep_title">03. Goals.</p>
          <p class="jeep_desc">
            The primary goal of Go Jeep is to provide a safer, more efficient
            jeepney transportation experience in the wake of the COVID-19
            pandemic. The app aims to address the challenges of public
            transportation during the "new normal" by offering features such as
            advance booking and contact tracing, which promote safety, reduce
            crowding, and support health protocols. By allowing users to book
            jeepney rides in advance, Go Jeep minimizes physical contact between
            passengers and drivers, ensuring a safer travel environment. The
            contact tracing feature helps track and trace passengers in case of
            potential exposure, supporting public health efforts in managing the
            spread of the virus. Additionally, Go Jeep seeks to ensure that
            jeepney drivers can continue to earn a livelihood while adhering to
            health and safety standards. The platform’s goal is to enhance the
            overall public transportation system by providing a user-friendly,
            accessible, and safer alternative to traditional jeepney travel,
            thus improving both public safety and convenience.

          <p class="jeep_title">05. Learning and Takeaway.</p>
          <p class="jeep_desc">
            My primary takeaway from this project is that when creating
            products, they should not only fulfill a market need but also aim to
            solve real-world problems that have an impact on society. Through
            the development of Go Jeep, I’ve learned the importance of designing
            solutions that address both individual and collective challenges. In
            this case, the problem of safely navigating public transportation
            during the COVID-19 pandemic required a thoughtful approach to both
            user safety and the livelihood of jeepney drivers. This project
            taught me the value of user-centric design, where the needs of the
            community—such as health security, convenience, and
            accessibility—are at the forefront of the development process. By
            integrating features like advance booking and contact tracing, Go
            Jeep doesn’t just provide a service, but actively contributes to
            public health and safety.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="jeep_desc">
            Another key takeaway is the importance of sustainability and
            adaptability in design. The solution should not only address
            immediate concerns (such as pandemic-related safety) but also be
            adaptable to future challenges, ensuring long-term relevance. This
            experience has reinforced the idea that, as a technopreneur, my
            responsibility is not just to innovate but to create products that
            have a meaningful and positive impact on the community.
