          <p class="abel_sub">What is Game Based Learning.</p>
          <p class="abel_desc">
            Game-based learning refers to an engaging approach to education that
            employs games as a means to enhance student learning. By
            participating in these games, students actively acquire knowledge,
            thereby fostering the development of vital cognitive abilities such
            as critical thinking and problem solving. Game-based learning can
            encompass both digital and non-digital games as well as simulations,
            enabling students to directly experience the learning process.
          </p>
          <p class="abel_sub">Purpose.</p>
          <p class="abel_desc">
            The main purpose of this study is to help enhance the students’
            health literacy, particularly on the prevention and control of
            communicable diseases to avoid, if not lessen, the chances of
            another global health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic in the
            country. By the end of the study, it aims to determine if game-based
            learning was effective in teaching Health education, specifically
            about preventing and controlling communicable diseases, to Grade 8
            students of Camarines Sur National High School (CSNHS).

          <p class="abel_sub">Game Title Inspiration.</p>
          <p class="abel_desc">
            The title Dr. Abel’s Adventures was inspired by Dr. Abelardo
            Aguilar, a Filipino physician from Iloilo who discovered the
            antibiotic properties of Streptomyces Erythreus in 1949. His work
            led to the development of Erythromycin, a widely used antibiotic,
            though he was not credited for the discovery. The proponents chose
            to honor Dr. Aguilar to highlight his significant, though
            overlooked, contribution to medicine and to encourage young learners
            to appreciate the important achievements of past generations.
          </p>
          <p class="abel_sub">Game Storyline.</p>
          <p class="abel_desc">
            After studying medicine for four years at Ateneo de Naga University,
            Abel decided to complete his residency at the local hospital. He
            spent three years training at the same medical center and became a
            licensed doctor. However, before he could even begin practicing,
            Abel received devastating news. His beloved grandfather had passed
            away due to lung complications caused by a virus and poor lifestyle
            choices. Heartbroken, Abel decided to put his career on hold and
            tend to his grandfather’s house, which had been left to him. When he
            arrived back in his hometown, he was greeted by the province’s
            mayor, who expressed his condolences and shared his concerns about
            the state of the town’s healthcare system. The mayor explained that
            many people in the area were struggling with health issues due to
            the lack of proper services and medical personnel. Curious about
            Abel’s background, the mayor asked about his past jobs and hobbies.
            Learning that Abel was a recent medical graduate, the mayor saw an
            opportunity to improve the town’s healthcare services. He offered
            Abel a plot of land to build his clinic and asked for help solving
            the town’s health problems. Although initially hesitant, Abel
            accepted the mayor’s offer and vowed to do his best to provide the
            town with the healthcare it deserved.

          <p class="abel_sub">Gameplay and Mechanics.</p>
          <p class="abel_desc">
            Inspired by Pokemon and Stardew Valley, Dr. Abel’s Adventures
            follows Dr. Abel, a newly graduated doctor, as he builds a clinic in
            his hometown. To gather resources and services, he must first help
            various NPCs by diagnosing their health problems. The game features
            four chapters, each focusing on different pathogens (bacteria,
            viruses, fungi, and parasites), with scenarios covering
            characteristics, transmission, causes, myths, and prevention.
            Players interact with two types of NPCs: Patient NPCs, who need help
            identifying their health issues, and Information NPCs, who provide
            useful chapter-related details. Success in diagnosing Patient NPCs
            leads to resources for building the clinic, while incorrect answers
            cause the player to lose trust (represented by hearts). Losing all
            hearts results in game over. Chests scattered throughout the map
            offer trivia questions that can restore lost trust. To win, players
            must correctly diagnose all Patient NPCs and gather the necessary
            resources to complete the clinic.

          <p class="abel_sub">Research Design.</p>
          <p class="abel_desc">
            This study employed a Non-Equivalent Group Quasi-Experimental
            design, where two groups were selected to compare learning outcomes.
            The experimental group, 8-Mars, used the game-based learning tool to
            study communicable diseases, while the control group, 8-Mercury,
            followed the traditional teacher-led lesson plan. This design
            allowed the researchers to assess whether using the game-based tool
            significantly improved students' learning outcomes.
          </p>
          <p class="abel_sub">Conduct of Study.</p>
          <p class="abel_desc">
            The system was tested using pre-test and post-test questionnaires.
            For the experimental group (8-Mars), a pre-test on each chapter was
            administered before playing the game, followed by the game, and a
            post-test afterward to assess their learning. The control group
            (8-Mercury) followed the teacher’s lesson plan without using the
            game. On the final day, both groups took a summative test on the
            topics covered.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="abel_desc">
            The researchers then compared the pre-test and post-test scores to
            evaluate learning outcomes for both groups. Finally, the
            experimental group's results were compared to the control group to
            determine if the game-based learning tool significantly improved
            learning outcomes compared to traditional teaching methods.

            differences in learning outcomes between the experimental group,
            which tested the game, and the controlled group, which received

            the pre-test and post-test results. The results from the four-day
            experiment showed that on Day 1, the post-test scores (Mean=9.0278,
            SD=1.1081) were significantly higher than the pre-test scores
            (Mean=7.5833, SD=1.6966). Day 2 showed no significant difference,
            with post-test scores (Mean=8.3404, SD=1.7229) slightly higher than
            pre-test scores (Mean=7.9574, SD=1.4136). Day 3 and Day 4 results
            both showed significant improvements, with post-test scores greater
            than pre-test scores on both days (Day 3: Post-test Mean=7.9545,
            SD=1.5243 vs. Pre-test Mean=7.2727, SD=1.7962; Day 4: Post-test
            Mean=7.3261, SD=2.0446 vs. Pre-test Mean=6.4130, SD=1.6677).
            Overall, the game-based system improved learning outcomes on three
            out of four days (75%), indicating a satisfactory or average
            performance.

          <p class="abel_desc">
            The study also aimed to compare the learning outcomes between the
            experimental group (8-Mars), who used the game, and the control
            group (8-Mercury), who followed the traditional teaching method. The
            hypothesis was that the experimental group would score higher on the
            summative test. To test this, an independent t-test was conducted on
            the summative test scores of both groups. The results showed that
            while the experimental group (8-Mars) had a higher mean score
            (Mean=20.3333, SD=2.7031) compared to the control group (8-Mercury)
            with a mean score of 19.8000 (SD=1.9141), there was no sufficient
            evidence to conclude that the difference in scores was statistically
            significant. Therefore, the game did not show a significant
            improvement over the traditional teaching method based on the
            summative test results.

          <p class="abel_desc">
            With the poor health literacy that the Philippines is facing despite
            the current efforts of the government to integrate health-related
            subjects in the DepEd curriculum to teach the students as early as
            possible, finding other means to educate the people can be helpful
            to increase the reach of their efforts in improving the country’s
            health literacy. This study aimed to use the popularity of video
            games to the masses to create an accessible game-based learning tool
            and determine its effectiveness in teaching topics about the
            Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases. By creating Dr.
            Abel’s Adventure and testing it on the students of Camarines Sur
            National High School, the study has found that using Game-based
            learning in teaching topics about Prevention and Control of
            Communicable diseases helped improve the learners’ knowledge and
            awareness about the subject. Although the learning outcome of the
            Experimental group that tested the game does not significantly
            differ from the learning outcome of the Control group, the study was
            still able to serve its original purpose, which was to help enhance
            its players’ health literacy. Additionally, the findings from this
            study have shown the importance of having thorough instructions and
            introduction of the game to the users in providing a good user
            experience. Implementing a rundown on each element in the game can
            help the users accomplish actions in the game easily, even on their
            first try.

            Entering a new project is always a challenge, especially when
            collaborating with others, such as working with kids from different
            schools. Despite the internal challenges we faced while creating
            this capstone project, I truly enjoyed my time there, particularly
            interacting with the teachers and students. Although we encountered
            some obstacles, we chose to focus on being beginners and not letting
            the problems define us. Instead, we persevered and kept our focus on
            learning and improving.

            As I worked on this project, I realized how much I love the process
            of designing and being involved in the creative aspects of project
            development. From the story and character design to the color
            choices, every element was something I truly enjoyed working on and
            aimed to perfect.
