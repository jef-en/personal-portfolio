            Paw Hub is a mobile startup application that is made using Flutter
            which aims to enhance pet care and veterinary services in Naga City,
            Philippines by centralising the veterinary shops in the area. The
            application boasts four main features: Pet Record - which provides a
            platform for vets and pet owners to access the pet’s data, including
            vaccination records and medical history, Booking Vet Services -
            which enables pet owners to view partner clinic schedules and
            schedule appointments at their preferred time and date, Marketplace
            - which offers a diverse range of pet-related products for sale,
            catering to the needs of pet owners and enthusiasts, and Events -
            which displays upcoming pet-related events (e.g., Free Neuter and
            Spay), ensuring users stay informed and can attend relevant events.

          <p class="pawhub_desc">
            Pet owners in Naga City faced significant challenges due to the lack
            of centralised veterinary services. The absence of a unified
            platform made it difficult for them to find and choose nearby
            veterinary services that met their needs. This lack of
            centralization led to inefficiencies and frustrations, as users had
            to search through various sources to locate and evaluate veterinary
            options.
          </p>
          <p class="pawhub_sub">Research Findings.</p>
          <p class="pawhub_desc">
            Through preliminary research and user interviews, we identified
            several key issues:
          </p>
          <ul class="pawhub_problem">
            <li class="pawhub_desc">
              Fragmented Information: Pet owners had to gather information from
              multiple sources, including scattered online listings and physical
              directories.
            </li>
            <li class="pawhub_desc">
              Accessibility Issues: Without a centralised platform, users had
              trouble finding the most convenient and nearest veterinary
              services.
            </li>
            <li class="pawhub_desc">
              Lack of Comparative Data: Users had limited means to compare
              services, reviews, and prices for veterinary care in their area.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="goals">
          <p class="pawhub_title">03. Goals.</p>
          <p class="pawhub_desc">
            The primary goal of Paw Hub is to create a mobile application that
            centralises all veterinary shops and clinics in Naga City, making it
            easier for pet owners to access various veterinary services and
            compare prices. One of its key features is the ability to show pet
            owners the nearest veterinary services based on their location.
            Additionally, the app includes a digital medical record system,
            allowing pet owners to store their pets' health information in a
            centralised, digital format.

          <p class="pawhub_title">04. Design Process.</p>
          <p class="pawhub_sub">Colors and Fonts.</p>
          <p class="pawhub_desc">
            Since the primary focus of our app is pet-related, we’ve designed
            the user experience to be vibrant and engaging by incorporating
            bright, fun colors. This not only reflects the playful and joyful
            nature of pets but also creates an inviting and friendly atmosphere
            for users. For the font, we’ve chosen Lexend, a typeface that
            enhances readability and accessibility, ensuring a smooth and
            enjoyable browsing experience for all users.
          </p>
          <p class="pawhub_sub">User Flow.</p>
          <p class="pawhub_desc">
            The user flow diagrams illustrate the seamless journey users take
            through the app, from start to finish. By mapping out key
            interactions and decision points, I was able to identify the most
            intuitive paths for users to follow, ensuring a smooth and efficient
            experience. These flows serve as a blueprint for both the design and
            development teams, highlighting critical screens, features, and
            transitions. The goal was to reduce friction, streamline navigation,
            and ensure that each action within the app feels logical and
            purposeful, guiding users effortlessly toward their objectives.

          <p class="pawhub_sub">Mid Fidelity Mockups.</p>
          <p class="pawhub_desc">
            In this phase of the design process, I created mid-fidelity mockups
            to bring structure and functionality to the app's user interface.
            These mockups showcase the app's core layout, navigation, and
            interactions with more defined UI elements like buttons, text, and
            icons, while still allowing room for iteration. They offer a clearer
            sense of the user experience, helping to visualize the flow and
            overall design before refining the final details in high-fidelity
            prototypes.

            High-fidelity mockups showcasing detailed and polished designs that
            closely mirror the final product. These mockups highlight user

            realistic preview of the user experience.

          <p class="pawhub_desc">
            The work is very challenging since it’s a new environment for me.
            It’s not the usual 'classroom setting'; I’m actually producing
            professional output. However, as they say, pressure and challenges
            are a good thing because they can serve as a catalyst for growth.
            They push me out of my comfort zone and encourage more creative
            problem-solving.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="pawhub_desc">
            I’m learning to think more critically and adapt quickly to new
            situations, which is sharpening my ability to approach problems from
            different perspectives. This experience has also been invaluable for
            developing time management skills and working under pressure, which
            are essential in any professional setting. I’m gaining confidence in
            making decisions independently and taking ownership of my tasks. On
            top of that, it's helping me become more comfortable with
            collaboration—whether it's brainstorming with colleagues, seeking
            feedback, or finding common ground to solve problems together.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="pawhub_desc">
            Overall, it’s a valuable experience to kick-start my career, and
            it’s allowing me to build a solid foundation for future growth. I'm
            not only growing professionally but also learning the importance of
            teamwork and communication in achieving success.
